[00:06.98] On the edges time
[00:39.73] Is still forever waiting for you
[00:48.93] Sing choosing like a child.
[01:02.43] 
[00:56.08] Brilliant midnight,
[00:59.56] Selfish in pleasures
[01:05.72] Knowing when to know to turn
[01:11.57] Or go alone.
[01:17.57] 
[01:14.42] On the water
[01:56.46] You hold a face reflected paler
[02:04.10] Than the hands measuring the sands.
[02:21.60] 
[02:13.87] Silver water bright as a thief
[02:23.63] Easy of belief
[02:27.16] A stlillness in release.
